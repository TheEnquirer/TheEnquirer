# How goes it?

I'm TheEnquirer, also known as, well, just Enquirer (and sometimes Abstract Giraffe.) 

I'm a highschooler in the Bay Area, an avid (neo)vim user, and more importantly, someone who loves to make things. Coding is one of the ways I pursue that love, and that's what github is here for! 


Some non-private repos and projects you can check out are
